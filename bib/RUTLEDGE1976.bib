abstract = {Ecological stability defined as the ability of an ecosystem to resist changes in the presence of perturbations leads to consideration of the effective choice of the pathways for energy flow. The roles of diversity and complexity (i.e. interdependence) in determining stability arise naturally in the development of an index from the qualitative concepts of information theory. As a tool for ecosystem analysis, the stability measure developed in this paper is applied to two example systems.}
