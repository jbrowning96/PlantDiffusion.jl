abstract = {A plant growth model has been developed as a component of a general rangeland production and utilization model (SPUR). The carbon and nitrogen content of standing green, live roots, propagules, standing dead, litter, dead roots, soil organic matter and soil inorganic nitrogen are simulated. The model can simultaneously simulate up to seven plant species or species groups on a total of nine heterogeneous range sites. It incorporates processes which are common to C3 and C4 plants but does not consider plants with Crassulacean Acid Metabolism. When coupled with the other components of the SPUR model, the plant component allows testing of grazing management, environmental variation, and fertilizer application.}
