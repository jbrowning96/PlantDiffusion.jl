abstract = {This paper is concerned with the mathematical modelling of complex interactions between plant species in a harsh environment such as in the arctic. The aim of the paper is to consider whether interactions between the species change in character as environments change. For example, if the effect of climate change is to make harsh climates more benign, will this imply changes in the way species interact and affect biodiversity? We consider the interaction of two species of grass. Our model is constructed based on the notion of a summer season when the plants grow, followed by a winter season when there is no growth but when the plants are subject to the effects of events such as winter storms. Our aim is to investigate changes when the summer season is lengthened, when the climate becomes more benign, when the susceptibility of plants to damage as a result of storms is increased, and when the intensity (and number) of winter storms is varied. The models we consider provide new insights into the known behaviour of plant species interactions in such situations and a basis for further modelling and prediction.}
