abstract = {Mathematical models in many fields of the physical sciences involve nonlocal terms which are formally similar to convolution integrals. We show that it is possible to approximate a particular class of such integrals, which by themselves are not convolutions, as a linear combination of convolution integrals, allowing for their efficient numerical computation as an O(NlogN) process.}
