# Plant Reaction-Diffusion Simulation

This project aims to implement various Reaction-Diffusion models to simulate the effects of harsh climates on plant communities. It is inspired by Problem A of the Mathematical Competition in Modeling from the year 2023.

## Background

Different species of plants respond differently to stresses, such as drought. The frequency and severity of droughts can vary, and it has been observed that plant communities with a greater number of species are better adapted to drought conditions over successive generations. This project seeks to explore the relationship between the number of species in a plant community and their ability to adapt to irregular weather cycles, specifically focusing on drought periods.

### Requirements

The projects requirements were, as outlined by the Mathematical Competition in Modeling, are as follows:

1. Develop a mathematical model to predict how a plant community changes over time when exposed to irregular weather cycles, including drought periods. The model should consider interactions between different species during droughts.
2. Draw conclusions from the model regarding the long-term interactions between plant communities and the larger environment. Consider the impact of the number and types of species, frequency and variation of drought occurrence, as well as factors like pollution and habitat reduction.
3. Provide recommendations based on the model to ensure the long-term viability of plant communities and assess their impact on the larger environment.
